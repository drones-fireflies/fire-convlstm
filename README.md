## Overview

**Fire-ConvLSTM** is an open-source framework for **fast wildfire spread prediction**
based on **Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)** networks.

The model is designed to approximate a wildfire propagation simulator with
**faster runtime**, enabling integration into **guidance, and reinforcement learning loops**, particularly for **UAV-based wildfire monitoring**.
